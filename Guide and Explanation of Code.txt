Limitations of Code:

-Side lengths of map must be smaller than 100 for display to work
-Display name of all terrain and dummies at most can be 2 characters for display to work
-Terrain names & dummys names must be unique and consistently the same (they are used as keys in maps)
-Although foes summoned to flank a player is evaluated by their distnace to the player, the actually destianation coordinates assigned to the foe are "random", and may not be the most efficient / logical distribution. 
-After a foe has been summoned to flank a player, it will not change paths / lock onto a different player, not even if they meet. Nor will the foe attack the player in their vicinity, although the player might attack the foe. 
-After a player/foe has found someone to attack, they will not stop attacking that person UNTIL they are dead or the other is dead, not even if a dummy with even lower health arrives later
-Once a dummy is dead, its information is still stored in the map(s)
-The code isn't the most efficient,  nor most organized or consistent, and there might be some underlying issues/typos I haven't found yet
